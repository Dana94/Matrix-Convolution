# Matrix-Convolution
I did this in my last semester. I has to choose a programming language and learn about it and create a program with it. I chose Fortran.

[This site](http://songho.ca/dsp/convolution/convolution2d_example.html) may help you understand what I was doing.

Fortran was totally new to me when I started this program. I implemented recursion to minimize the length and to take full advantage of what I could accomplish in this language. Of course, I am no Fortan intellect. This is not my language of choice, but considering its history, I was happy that I chose an interesting language for this assignment.
